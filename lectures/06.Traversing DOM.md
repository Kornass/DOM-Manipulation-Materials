### DOM TRAVERSING

In the previous 02 section,we covered how to use the built-in methods of the `document` object to access HTML elements by ID, class, tag name, and query selectors. We know that the DOM is structured as a tree of nodes with the `document` node at the root and every other node (including elements, comments, and text nodes) as the various branches.

Often, you will want to move through the DOM without specifying each and every element beforehand. Learning how to navigate up and down the DOM tree and move from branch to branch is essential to understanding how to work with JavaScript and HTML.
