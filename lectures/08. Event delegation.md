### Event delegation

Capturing and bubbling allow us to implement one of the most powerful event handling patterns called _event delegation_.

The idea is that if we have a lot of elements handled in a similar way, then instead of assigning a handler to each of them â€“ we put a single handler on their common ancestor.

In the handler we get `event.target` to see where the event actually happened and handle it.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Event Delegation and Propagation Examples</h1>
  <ul id="list">
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
    <li>Item 4</li>
    <li>Item 5</li>
  </ul>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

Event delegation is a technique where we attach an event listener to a parent element and then use event propagation to handle events on its child elements.

```javascript
const list = document.getElementById("list");

list.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log("Clicked on:", event.target.textContent);
  }
});
```
